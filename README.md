# FairLens — Interpretable Bias Detection

---

FairLens is a **fairness-aware ML demo** that combines:
- **Bias Detection** — Quantify disparities in accuracy, false positive/negative rates across groups  
- **Bias Mitigation** — Apply methods like **Reweighting** and **Exponentiated Gradient (Fairlearn)**  
- **Interpretability** — Use **SHAP explainability** to visualize feature importance  

Built as a **multi-agent pipeline** with a polished **Streamlit UI**, it highlights responsible AI practices for healthcare and income prediction datasets.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Multi-agent pipeline**: modular agents for data loading, modeling, mitigation, evaluation, explanation.  
- **Datasets supported**:  
  - *Pima Indians Diabetes* (health prediction)  
  - *Adult Income* (census data)  
- **Bias mitigation methods**:  
  - Baseline (no mitigation)  
  - Reweighting (sample-weight rebalancing)  
  - ExponentiatedGradient (Fairlearn reductions)  
- **Explainability**: SHAP value plots for feature importance.  
- **Fairness metrics**: accuracy, precision, recall, FPR/FNR by group + fairness gaps.  
- **Interactive dashboard**: Streamlit UI with tabs, cards, and comparison tables.  
- **Static report**: auto-generated `report.ipynb` with reproducible analysis.

## 🌐 Demo (Streamlit)

## 🚀 Live Demo
👉 [Try the Streamlit app here]([https://your-streamlit-app-link](https://fairlens.streamlit.app/))  

- Dataset toggle: **Pima Diabetes** (healthcare) and **Adult Income** (socioeconomic)  
- Compare **Baseline vs Mitigation** side-by-side  
- Visualize **SHAP explanations** and **fairness gaps** (e.g., FPR difference, accuracy difference)

## 📊 Example Results

**Overall metrics (Baseline vs Reweight vs ExpGrad):**

| Metric     | Baseline | Reweight | ExpGrad |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Accuracy   | 0.74     | 0.74     | 0.75    |
| Precision  | 0.67     | 0.67     | 0.71    |
| Recall     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.49    |

**Fairness gap (FPR difference):** reduced after mitigation.
